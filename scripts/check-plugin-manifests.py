"""Verify generated plugin manifests are in sync with the canonical source.

Runs the build logic in dry mode: re-render every output, compare to the
committed file, and exit non-zero on any drift. Also validates the
Phase 2 (ADR-0001) invariants. The rule numbers below are the load-bearing
IDs used by drift messages, comments, tests, and docs — every rule block in
main() is labeled with its number, and this list is the canonical roster
(renumbered once, coherently, in #1172):

  1. Every hooks/<role>/<name>/ directory has ≥1 manifest entry
     (opt-in carve-out: external-write-falsify-check), and every manifest
     entry has a backing directory.
  2. Every manifest entry's `role` field matches the parent directory name.
  3. The impl file (`impl.py` or the body-as-sh `impl.sh`) exists on disk.
  4. completion-verify Stop ordering matches manifest array order.
  5. Generated `.claude-plugin/hooks/hooks.json` (+ peers) are byte-
     identical to what `build-plugin-manifests.py` would emit (this is
     the runtime contract — Claude Code reads the generated file).
  6. Generated runtime wrappers under hooks/*.sh are byte-identical to
     the generator output (Phase 2 strict diff replaces Phase 1's exec-
     target parity check). Dispatch-only members carry NO wrapper and are
     asserted absent from disk (Rule 6b, ADR-0002 Phase 4 / #618). Opt-in
     wrappers (OPT_IN_HOOKS, not in the manifest) are byte-identity checked
     too (Rule 6c, #605). Every expected wrapper on disk carries the
     executable bit and, when tracked, a 100755 git index mode (Rule 6d,
     #1172); and no orphan hooks/*.sh outside the generated set survives
     (Rule 6e, #1172 — the reverse sweep Rule 6 lacked).
  7. INDEX.md ↔ manifest entry cross-check (#1306: ARCHITECTURE.md no
     longer carries a per-hook table, so only docs/hook/INDEX.md is
     checked; the operating matrix is generated and drift-checked
     separately).
  8. Spec `Supported hosts:` ↔ manifest `hosts` cross-check.
  9. Release version wiring (#1172): `VERSION` equals the "." version in
     `.release-please-manifest.json`, and every versioned platform artifact
     (plugin, marketplace kinds — marketplace carries
     version fields too) is listed in release-please-config.json
     `extra-files` so release-please bumps its embedded versions.
  10. spec.md exists at hooks/<role>/<name>/spec.md for every registered
      hook (Phase 3, ADR-0001 §5.3 — specs collocated with impl), and a
      manifest `hosts` field, when present, is a non-empty list of strings.
  11. Runtime-sensitive skills carry runtime verification frontmatter
      (`verified-against-runtime`, `runtime-verified-at`,
      `runtime-verified-note`).
  12. skills/<skill-name>/ on disk matches the EXPECTED_SKILLS frozen set
     (issue #465 — surface freeze gate against silent skill proliferation).
  13. Doc drift invariants (issues #498, #1177): AGENTS.md "## Skills (N)"
     count and per-skill backtick tokens, docs/skills.md per-skill table
     rows, and the skills/using-praxis/SKILL.md routing tables (every skill
     routed by a table row, no phantom skill names in category rows or
     scenario routing cells) all match EXPECTED_SKILLS; docs/skills.md
     trigger-keyword cells quote keywords verbatim from each skill's
     frontmatter `when_to_use` (or `description`, #1331); and the
     compatibility-tier tables in
     README.md, AGENTS.md, and using-praxis stay normalized-identical.
  14. Each manifest `dispatch_groups` (event, matcher) collapses to exactly
     one dispatcher node per platform hooks.json (no member silently left as
     its own node, no second dispatcher node), and the runtime resolver
     `_dispatch.group_members` resolves the same member set the build
     collapsed (ADR-0002, #617 — ties build path and runtime path together).
  15. docs/hook/<name>.md redirect-stub parity (#606): every hook dir owns a
      byte-identical 1-line stub, and no orphan stub survives (INDEX.md and the
      hand-written NON_HOOK_DOCS allowlist excepted).
  16. Standalone hooks (any registration outside the dispatch-covered
      PreToolUse/Bash shape, plus opt-in hooks) apply `@fail_open` in
      impl.py — AST-checked, not substring (#645).
  17. Per-hook `mode` metadata in hooks/manifest.json (strict env, bypass env,
      state/path vars, read-only external commands) ↔ the human-readable views
      in docs/bypass-vars.md and SECURITY.md, cross-checked in both directions
      so neither can drift (#688). Opt-in hooks and shared/non-manifest rows are
      exempt (they own no manifest `mode` block).
  18. impl.sh hooks arm fire-ledger instrumentation with a line-anchored
      `praxis_fire_arm <name>` call (#848).
  19. Every `mktemp -d` assignment in tests/*.sh guards its own failure on
      the same line (#897).
  20. Spec `Requires:` ↔ manifest `requires` cross-check (#1158): a hook whose
      matcher is dead without an external component (cmux, zsh, codex plugin,
      hookable memory store, slack/notion MCP) declares it in both places or
      neither — the Rule 8 contract, applied to component dependencies.
  21. docs/hook-operating-matrix.md parity: generated hook operating surface
      summary is byte-identical to the manifest/env/security source render
      (#672). Numbered after 20 because its original label collided with
      Rule 16 (@fail_open); it took the next free number in #1172.
  22. Spec referenced-path existence (#1179): every repo-path-looking token in
      hooks/*/*/spec.md (backticked spans and fenced code blocks; contains a
      `/`, ends in .sh/.py/.md/.json, first segment is a checked top-level
      dir) must exist on disk, except deliberate phantom-path examples in
      SPEC_PATH_EXEMPT. (Numbered 22 to stay clear of rules added by
      parallel PRs.)
  23. README.md hook-aggregate counts (#1176): total hook dirs, manifest
      registration count, per-role dir counts, the number of distinct hooks
      carrying a variable in docs/bypass-vars.md, and how many advisory hooks
      a strict variable there can promote into blocking must all match the
      hand-written numbers at their anchored README phrases — the Rule 13
      doc-drift contract, applied to the hook surface. (Numbered 23 to stay
      clear of rules 21/22 added by a parallel PR.)

  24. Canonical matcher token order (#1168): every plain pipe-joined tool-name
      matcher (hooks and dispatch_groups alike) spells its tokens in sorted
      order with no duplicates, so identical matcher SETS share one literal
      spelling and can coalesce into one hooks.json group / dispatch group.
      Regex-y matchers (any token with characters outside [A-Za-z0-9]) are
      exempt, but an empty alternation token (`Edit|`) — which matches every
      tool — is drift. (Numbered 24 on rebase: this rule was authored as 21
      before rules 21-23 landed on main.)
  25. Generated dispatcher commands are shell-safe (#1198): every hooks.json
      `command` that invokes the dispatch wrapper, token-split the way `sh -c`
      would, yields no bare shell control-operator token — an unquoted
      pipe-carrying dispatch matcher would otherwise run as a pipeline and
      silently disable the whole group. Non-dispatcher commands are out of
      scope (a deliberate compound command is legitimate shell). (Numbered 25
      on rebase: authored as 22 before rules 21-23 landed on main.)
  26. Sunset review (#1300): every hook NAME carries a well-formed
      `review_by` date (YYYY-MM-DD; the first registration carries it and
      multi-event siblings may omit it, exactly like `hosts`) — REVIEW_BY
      MISSING / MALFORMED / CONFLICT — and that date is not in the past
      (REVIEW_BY OVERDUE). An overdue hook is re-audited, then either the
      date is bumped or the verdict is recorded in docs/hook-prune-audit.md;
      the rule exists because the audit found zero drops and cannot rank
      hooks by value, so without a deadline the roster only grows. The
      field never reaches a platform hooks.json (the node builder copies
      only command/timeout/hosts).
  27. README hook-dependency table (#1332): the `### Hook dependencies`
      table in README.md is the reader's view of the manifest `requires`
      field (Rule 20). Every component some hook declares has exactly one
      row, every row names a declared component, each row's hook cell is the
      exact set of hooks declaring it, and the install cell is non-empty —
      HOOK DEPS MISSING / ORPHAN / DRIFT / NO INSTALL. The audit that added
      `requires` (docs/hook-suitability-audit.md §B) found the README's tier
      table covered skills only, so a user without oh-my-claudecode or the
      codex plugin had nowhere to read which hooks were inert; `plugin.json`
      `dependencies` was rejected for this (no optional form — see
      ARCHITECTURE.md), so the declaration is documentary and this rule keeps
      it true.
  28. Claude-only events declare it (#1337): every registration on an event
      only Claude Code raises — `PostToolUseFailure`, `SubagentStop` — must
      carry `hosts: ["claude"]`. `hosts` is optional in the schema and an
      absent value means every host, so a registration that forgets it is
      written into the Codex and Cursor `hooks.json` for an event those hosts
      never fire. The schema states the contract in its `event` description;
      this is the half that enforces it, because JSON Schema's supported
      subset here cannot express "if event is X then hosts must be Y".
      (Numbered 28 to leave 27 to the parallel #1332 branch.)

An unnumbered auxiliary check verifies the Codex adapter symlinks
(plugins/praxis/{skills,hooks,scripts} → repo root).

  Schema gate (unnumbered — rule renumbering is owned by #1172): before any
      numbered rule runs, hooks/manifest.json is validated against
      hooks/manifest.schema.json via the stdlib walker in
      build-plugin-manifests.py (#1173, shared — the build runs the same gate
      before rendering), so a typo'd optional key, a wrong type, or an
      unknown enum value fails with a file+entry+key diagnostic instead of a
      KeyError deeper in the pipeline. Platform files
      (manifests/platforms/*.json) get the same treatment through
      _build.load_platform's checked access, including host_id membership in
      the schema's closed hosts enum; the reverse direction (stale enum value
      with no platform file) is checked here.

CI invokes this; developers can too, via `./scripts/check-plugin-manifests.py`.

    # the committed versioned artifacts and flagged disagreement. That check
    # was provably vacuous: Rule 5 renders every artifact from the single
    # VERSION source and demands byte-identity (a missing file reads as ""
    # and drifts too), so two artifacts can only disagree when Rule 5 has
    # already failed — the compare could never fire on its own, and its
    # marketplace fallback branch was dead code (marketplace was not even in
    # its versioned-kinds set). Deleted; replaced with checks that CAN fire:
    #
    #   (a) VERSION (the authoritative build input, see load_base) equals the
    #       "." version release-please tracks in .release-please-manifest.json
    #       — a mismatch means the next release PR computes its bump from a
    #       different version than the one the artifacts embed.
    #   (b) every platform output of a versioned kind (plugin, marketplace,
    #       agent-plugin — marketplace embeds version fields too) is listed
    #       in release-please-config.json `extra-files`, so a release
    #       bump rewrites its embedded versions. A new platform output added
    #       without the extra-files entry would otherwise ship stale versions
    #       on the first release after merge, with no gate noticing.

    # matcher (`... _dispatch.sh PreToolUse Edit|NotebookEdit|Write claude`)
    # was parsed as a 3-command PIPELINE — the dispatcher ran with matcher
    # 'Edit' (the wrong group) and its deny JSON was swallowed by the pipe,
    # so all nine grouped hooks never fired. Rule 14 and the pytest parity
    # suite both invoke the dispatcher directly and bypassed the shell, which
    # is why neither caught it. This rule simulates the shell's token split
    # (shlex with punctuation_chars — quoted operators stay inside their
    # token) and flags a bare control-operator token.

    # Scope: ONLY commands that invoke the dispatch wrapper. Those are the
