"""Tests for hooks/_lib/_dispatch.py — single-process group runner (ADR-0002, #613).

Coverage:
  - group_members: the PreToolUse(Bash) group resolves to the expected count/roles
  - per-hook equivalence: for a no-op payload, dispatcher `run_one` produces the
    same (exit, stdout, stderr) as running the hook's impl.py in a fresh
    subprocess — i.e. stdin reinjection + in-process invocation preserve behaviour
  - run_group on a no-op payload allows (exit 0, no decision JSON)
  - aggregation priority (deny > ask > allow) via fake members
  - crash isolation: a raising member is contained (fail_open) and does not abort
    the group
  - latency: the whole group runs well under the 37-process baseline
