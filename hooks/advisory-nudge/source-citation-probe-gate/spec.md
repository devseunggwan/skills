# PreToolUse Source-Citation Probe Gate

Supported hosts: all

`hooks/advisory-nudge/source-citation-probe-gate/impl.py` is a **default-on**
PreToolUse(Bash) advisory
that fires when an external-write body (PR/issue bodies and comments) cites
**source facts** — `file:line` references,
exact call syntax, or test-semantics claims — with **no read-probe** found in
the recent transcript or in the body itself.

It enforces the *Information Accuracy* rule's "checkmark = citation" clause
([`ETHOS.md` → Rules praxis carries](../../../ETHOS.md#rules-praxis-carries)) at the external-write surface: a source-fact
citation written from recall (not from a Read / `grep -n` executed this
session) is a fabrication-shaped claim, and publishing it trains downstream
readers (review bots, teammates) on potentially wrong specifics (issue #830).

Unlike `external-write-falsify-check` (opt-in — its hypothesis-marker rule
lacked a recurrence trail at adoption time), this hook is
**manifest-registered (default-on)**: the recall-prone-citation pattern has
an established recurrence trail and the clearing arm (any Read/grep of the
cited file) keeps the false-positive cost low.

## What is detected

Detection runs on the extracted write body after two preprocessing steps:
URLs are stripped (`\w+://\S+`), then fenced code blocks (paired ` ``` `)
are removed — code samples are `external-write-falsify-check`'s
author-exempt Check 2 territory (opt-in, not registered by default — that
surface is uncovered in a default install).

| Tier | Citation shape | Pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | `file:line` reference | `impl.py:42`, `hooks/foo/impl.py:42`, anchor form `impl.py#L42`; extension must start with a letter; TLD denylist {com, org, net, io, co, ai, dev} on the extension |
| T2 | exact call syntax | inside **inline code spans (single backticks) only**: `name(...)` whose argument list contains `.` or `[` — the weakest detector by design |
| T3 | test-semantics claim | `test*` token + `assert*` / `raise(s)` / `expect*` within an 80-char same-sentence window (case-insensitive) |

Surfaces scanned (shared with `external-write-falsify-check` — the gh argv
walk, extracted to
`_lib/_external_write_body.py` at the 3rd consumer per repo 2-copy
convention, issue #907):

- `gh issue|pr comment|create|edit`, `gh pr review` with `--body` / `-b` /
  `--body=` / `--body-file` / `-F` (file contents read best-effort)
- `gh api` with `POST` / `PATCH` / `PUT` against
  `repos/{o}/{r}/issues/comments/<id>`, `issues/<n>/comments`,
  `pulls/comments/<id>`, `pulls/<n>/comments` or `pulls/<n>/reviews`, body from
  `-f body=` / `--raw-field`, `-F body=@<file>` / `--field` (`@` expanded as gh
  expands it) — issue #1265. `--input` makes the body unknown and nothing is
  scanned, including beside a `body=` field, which gh sends as a query
  parameter rather than merging it into the file's request body. Any
  other method or endpoint stays outside: a read, `graphql`, a workflow
  dispatch. The verification-anchor convention makes this the only path a
  rev ≥2 anchor can take.

## Clearing — "probe basis present" (per citation)

**Arm A (in-body):**

- `[verified]` token on the citation's own line, OR
- a filled-in `Probe: <command> → <output>` line anywhere in the body.
  Anti-bypass ported from `output-block-falsify-advisory` (PR #796): a
  Probe line still carrying scaffold placeholders (`<command>`,
  `<observed>`, `<...>`, `<output>`) or with empty evidence after the
  arrow (`→` / `->`) does NOT clear.

**Arm B (transcript, last 400 JSONL lines):**

- T1 clears when a `Read` tool_use file_path basename equals the cited
  basename, or a read-tool Bash command (`grep` / `rg` / `sed` / `cat` /
  `head` / `tail` / `awk` / `nl`) contains it.
- T2 clears when the called function name appears in any transcript Bash
  command or Read file_path.
- T3 clears on a `pytest` run or a `test_*` file basename in a transcript
  Bash command / Read.

## Response

```text
REMINDER (External-Surface Write / Source-Citation Probe): body cites
source facts ({up to 3 samples}) with no read-probe found in the recent
transcript.
file:line, exact call syntax, and test-semantics claims are recall-prone —
re-read the cited site (Read / grep -n) before publishing, then cite inline
(`Probe: <command> → <output>`) or append `[verified]` on the citation line
after checking.
This gate only sees external-write bodies — free conversational prose is
NOT covered (known limit).
Set PRAXIS_SOURCE_CITATION_STRICT=1 to convert this advisory into a hard
block (exit 2).
```

Default mode emits the reminder to stderr and **exits 0** (advisory, not
block). Set `PRAXIS_SOURCE_CITATION_STRICT=1` to convert into a hard block
(exit 2). The env var accepts the **literal value `1` only** — `true` /
`yes` / `on` do NOT activate strict mode.

## Known limits

- **Conversational prose is not covered.** A PreToolUse hook only sees tool
  inputs — a recall-fabricated `file:line` in the assistant's free prose
  response never passes through this gate. This is an accepted structural
  limit of the enforcement point (issue #830 AC).
- **Heredoc / stdin (`--body-file -`) / relative-path body-file silently
  fail-open.** `gh ... --body-file -` streams via stdin; a heredoc body is
  not visible in the argv; a relative `--body-file` path resolves against
  the hook's cwd, not the worktree. All three record an empty body — no
  scan. Use an absolute-path `--body-file` when you want the body scanned.
- **Literal `\n` inside a quoted `--body` value splits the body.** The
  shared `_hook_utils.safe_tokenize` treats literal `\n` characters as
  command separators inside quoted strings (same limit as
  `external-write-falsify-check`).
- **Fenced code blocks are excluded** from all tiers — identifiers inside
  ` ``` ` blocks are `external-write-falsify-check`'s author-exempt Check 2
  territory (opt-in, off by default). Unclosed fences leave their content
  scanned (accepted).
- **Scheme-less `domain:port` outside the TLD denylist may false-positive.**
  `internal.corp:8080` has extension `corp` (not in the denylist) and a
  digit run after the colon — it matches T1. The denylist covers the common
  public TLDs only.
- **T2 is the weakest detector.** Call syntax without a `.` / `[` in the
  argument list (`foo(x)`) is deliberately not matched, and a matching
  function name anywhere in any transcript Bash command clears it — recall
  is bounded, precision is prioritized.

## Parsing guarantees

Inherited from `_hook_utils.safe_tokenize` (same primitive as
`external-write-falsify-check` / `side-effect-scan`): quoted strings,
comments, and `echo` arguments do not match; env prefixes (`FOO=1 gh ...`)
and wrapper commands are peeled; subshells (`$(...)`) are opaque to shlex.
Malformed stdin JSON, missing `transcript_path`, and unreadable transcript
files all fail-open (exit 0, no output).

**Slack / Notion MCP writes are out of scope (#1359).** The
`mcp__.*slack.*|mcp__.*notion.*` registration this hook carried was dropped
on an owner judgement: it hardcoded two vendors into the runtime surface for
a leg that only reaches an installer who has such a server, and no fire was
ever measured on it. The rule itself is unchanged — it still fires on every
`gh` external write. The body extractor those writes used
(`_lib/_external_write_body.py`) stays: the opt-in
`external-write-falsify-check` still consumes it.
